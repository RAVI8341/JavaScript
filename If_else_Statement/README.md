# JavaScript Projects Using if else Statements

This repository contains a collection of ten JavaScript projects that utilize if else statements to build practical applications.

## Project Ideas

1. **Temperature Converter**
   - Description: Create a temperature converter that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
   - Implementation: Utilize if else statements to determine the conversion formula based on user input.

2. **Grade Calculator**
   - Description: Convert numerical grades to letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) using predefined grade ranges.
   - Implementation: Utilize if else statements to assign letter grades based on specific conditions.

3. **BMI Calculator**
   - Description: Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight inputs.
   - Implementation: Use if else conditions to categorize BMI into underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.

4. **Password Strength Checker**
   - Description: Evaluate password strength based on defined criteria (length, characters, etc.).
   - Implementation: Use if else statements to determine and display the strength level of the password.

5. **Number Guessing Game**
   - Description: Create a game where users guess a randomly generated number.
   - Implementation: Utilize if else statements to provide hints (higher/lower) based on user guesses.

6. **Simple Calculator**
   - Description: Develop a basic calculator for arithmetic operations using user input.
   - Implementation: Use if else statements to determine the operation to be performed (addition, subtraction, etc.).

7. **User Authentication System**
   - Description: Build a simple authentication system using usernames and passwords.
   - Implementation: Use if else statements to verify user-entered credentials against predefined values.

8. **Discount Calculator**
   - Description: Calculate discounts in a shopping cart based on total purchase amounts.
   - Implementation: Use if else statements to apply different discount rates based on total purchases.

9. **Traffic Light Simulator**
   - Description: Simulate a traffic light system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implementation: Control traffic light behavior (red, yellow, green) in a timed sequence using if else statements.

10. **Quiz Game**
    - Description: Develop a quiz game with multiple-choice questions.
    - Implementation: Utilize if else statements to compare user-selected answers with correct answers and update scores.

These projects can be expanded upon and customized further based on individual preferences and creative ideas. They serve as a starting point to practice using if else statements in JavaScript while building functional applications.
